# MemoLang

Mobile web-based application done with Apache Cordova framework that aids foreign language word memorization through the flashcard method. This repository is the equivalent of Cordova's "www" project folder, the front-end of the application.

### Functionalities
- Creating, editing, deleting lists and words inside each list.
- Sharing lists with other users. For now a list is only copied from a source user when the target accepts a share invitation.
- Games involving the words inside each lists.
